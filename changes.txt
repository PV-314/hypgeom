add new element to the end of the array returned from make_sequences() in hypg-utils.gp.
It now also returns a lower bound for the largest y_k calculated and checked

check_abdtu() in bPP-end-proof-check.gp now uses this new element from make_sequences() for its checks

effectivity parts of bPP-Prop31-sequence-proof-calcs.gp removed, as no longer included in paper
