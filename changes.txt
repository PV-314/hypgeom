added any-b subdirectory with
--maple\bAll-nASqr-proof-calcs.txt Maple code for checking proof of Theorem 1.3 in ``Bounds on the number of squares in recurrence sequences: $y_{0}=b^{2}$ (I)''
--pari\bAll-nASqr-proof-calcs.txt PARI/GP code for Theorem 1.3(a) calcs in ``Bounds on the number of squares in recurrence sequences: $y_{0}=b^{2}$ (I)''

==========
add new element to the end of the array returned from make_sequences() in hypg-utils.gp.
It now also returns a lower bound for the largest y_k calculated and checked

check_abdtu() in bPP-end-proof-check.gp now uses this new element from make_sequences() for its checks

effectivity parts of bPP-Prop31-sequence-proof-calcs.gp removed, as no longer included in paper
